# Precision_Agriculture_ML_Model
This project presents a machine learning model for predicting dragon fruit yield under Bangalore-specific agro-climatic conditions. The model is designed to capture the unique environmental, soil, and farm management characteristics of the Bangalore region, which are often not well represented in generic agricultural yield models.
